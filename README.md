# Welcome!
My name is Jamie but everyone calls me Thorn, I am an 18 year old Freelance Developer who is eager to push the boundaries of what is possible in software development. I have been programming since early 2015 and have learned so much in my time. I am currently working on a game development company (Nightraid Studios), I am a determined person who believes knowledge is the best form of perception. I believe that you cannot understand what you have not done.

# Current Projects

## Nightraid Studios
Nightraid Studios is a community project that I started in the beginning of 2021. I wanted an environment where my development progress wasn't just limited to a certain game. Any Language is accepted as long as the work is original and does what it is supposed to. \
