# Welcome!
My name is Optical and I am an 18 year old Freelance Developer who is eager to push the boundaries of what is possible in software development. I have been programming since early 2015 and have learned so much in my time. I also work on robotics (Arduino and rasberry PI) which I have been doing since 2013. I am not nearly as active as I used to since I took a break from Legend Network but I look forward to still working on future projects.

# Current Projects

## Legend Network
Legend Network was a personal project of mine for years. I started this massive project back in 2017 and I never though I would get this much support. I want to thank everyone who has ever supported me on this crazy rollercoaster ride.

## Matrix Development
Matrix Development is a community project that I started in the beginning of 2021. I wanted an environment where my development progress wasn't just limited to Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Any Language is accepted as long as the work is original and does what it is supposed to. \

## The JBX
The JailBreak Experience is a community of Counter Strike: Source players I met after taking a break on Legend Network. They run their own server using sourcemod for plugins(Which sourcepawn turned out to be a pretty simple language). I do small patches here and there for them when they need it.
