# Welcome!
My name is Jamie but everyone calls me Thorn, I am an 19 year old Freelance Developer who is eager to push the boundaries of what is possible in software development. I have been programming since early 2015 and have learned so much in my time. I am currently working on a game development company (Nightraid Studios), I am a determined person who believes knowledge is the best form of perception. I believe that you cannot understand what you have not done.
